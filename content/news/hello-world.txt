Hello, World!

I'm officially releasing the `squareball` website. We already released two
versions of the library a long time ago, but we hadn't a proper website yet.

Here you'll find release announcements, downloads, documentation, etc.

A new version should be announced soon, stay tuned!

Cheers,  
Rafael
