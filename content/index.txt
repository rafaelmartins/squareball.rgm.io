#### squareball is simple...

squareball was initially developed as a helper library for
[blogc](https://blogc.rgm.io/), that was extracted afterwards, to allow it
to be reused in other projects. `blogc` is simple, so `squareball` is simple
as well. :)

#### squareball is portable...

`squareball` is often tested on Linux, and OSX, but the code should work
on any POSIX-compliant operating system and Windows. Patches for portability
are always welcome and have high priority. Some features may not be available
for Windows, please check the documentation.

#### squareball is powerful...

The routines implemented are simple, but yet optimized for the specific use
cases described in the documentation.

#### squareball is incomplete...

Some implementations are incomplete, missing some functions that may be
required for some use case. The first versions are strictly based on the
code extracted from `blogc`, then only the functionality needed by `blogc`
was implemented in most of the cases.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Why not just use something like `GLib`?

`GLib` was released under the LGPL, we wanted our code to be released under the
BSD 3 clause license. Also, implementing these algorithms is a fun exercise. :)

#### What the name "squareball" means?

`squareball` library name is a tribute to [Quico](http://hero.wikia.com/wiki/Quico),
that was Carlos Villagr√°n's character in the Mexican television sitcom *El Chavo
del Ocho*. Unfortunately Quico never got his promised square ball. :-(
